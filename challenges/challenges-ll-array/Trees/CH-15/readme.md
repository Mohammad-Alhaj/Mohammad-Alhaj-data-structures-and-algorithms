## Challenge

In this challenge we create binary trees and binary search trees in binary tree we create three methods
in order , preOrder ,postOrder and in binary search tree we create insert method and contains 

## Approach & Efficiency
In binary tree the big (o)  
= time big (n),space big(w)
In binary search tree = time big(log(n)),space big (1)
