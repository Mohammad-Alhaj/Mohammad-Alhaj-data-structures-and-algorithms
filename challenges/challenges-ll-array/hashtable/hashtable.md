# Hashtables

firstly we hash the key the result of hashing is index of array who which story value inside it
before story the data and key we should check if the index have another key if have another key
i should create linked list and added a new key and a value to linked list 
now we have an array and in some element we have ether one value or linked list that story all values


## Approach & Efficiency
If we know the index of the information we want we can access that information in**O(1)**time. The reason why searching for a piece of data in a collection is **O(N)** isn’t because the array is slow, it’s just that we have to look through all N things in the collection.
