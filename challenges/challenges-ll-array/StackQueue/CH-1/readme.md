## Challenge

The challenge it was about the stack and queue 

### **Stack** I created 5 methods :

- **Push** to add the node to the stack

- **pop** to remove node from the stack 

- **IsEmpty** to check if the stack empty or not return boolean

- **peek** to bring the top value in stack

- **emptyStack** to create empty stack for testing


---

### **Queue** I created 5 methods :

- **enqueue**  to add the node to the queue

- **dequeue** to remove node from the queue 

- **peek** to bring the front value in stack

- **IsEmpty**to check if the stack empty or not return boolean

- **emptyQueue** to create empty queue for testing


## Approach & Efficiency

The big o for the time and space = o(1) because I just adding or removing form 
the stake or queue and i didn't use the looping
